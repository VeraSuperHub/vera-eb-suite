# NIW Skill Suite

> Hi, I'm **Vera** — a silicon-based rabbit and AI immigration agent, created by Veronica.
>
> Veronica has a PhD in Quantitative Sciences, 10+ years across quantitative research, AI, and clinical trials, with publications in psychometrics and human-AI collaboration. She also went through the NIW process herself. She created me to handle the parts of petition preparation that can be systematized. She reviews, tests, and decides what ships.
>
> Everything in this repo is what I can do. What I can't do is assess whether your specific case will be approved, give legal advice, or replace an experienced immigration attorney. That's a human job.

**Open-source AI skills that guide petitioners through the complete EB-2 National Interest Waiver process — from initial case evaluation to RFE response.**

Each skill encodes attorney-level reasoning patterns derived from [5,000+ AAO (Administrative Appeals Office) decisions](https://www.uscis.gov/administrative-appeals/aao-decisions) and updated with 2024–2025 adjudication trends. Built for [Claude](https://claude.ai).

> **Why this exists:** Immigration is high-stakes and information asymmetry shouldn't determine outcomes. A seasoned NIW attorney makes dozens of judgment calls during petition preparation — most follow discoverable patterns. This project decomposes those patterns into modular, testable, improvable AI skills so every applicant can access expert-level guidance.

## Skills

| # | Skill | What It Does | Lines |
|---|-------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | [`vera-niw-evaluate`](vera-niw-evaluate/) | Evaluates the petitioner's profile, selects the optimal pathway, identifies strengths and gaps, and produces a go/no-go recommendation with a confidence score | 672 |
| 2 | [`vera-niw-endeavor`](vera-niw-endeavor/) | Drafts the national importance endeavor statement — the single paragraph USCIS reads first — using field-specific framing patterns | 394 |
| 3 | [`vera-niw-pillar`](vera-niw-pillar/) | Writes the three-pillar petition letter covering Prong 1 (substantial merit + national importance), Prong 2 (well-positioned), and Prong 3 (balance of equities). Run once per pillar. | 510 |
| 4 | [`vera-niw-recommendation`](vera-niw-recommendation/) | Generates recommendation letters with writer-specific voice calibration, ensuring each letter covers different evidence angles without redundancy | 574 |
| 5 | [`vera-niw-assemble`](vera-niw-assemble/) | Assembles the final petition package — petition letter, exhibit list, and supporting documents — as an attorney-quality .docx with cross-reference verification | 334 |
| 6 | [`vera-niw-pl-review`](vera-niw-pl-review/) | Adversarial pre-filing review simulating a USCIS officer — 10 denial-pattern checks (A–J) mapped to real AAO denial grounds | 670 |
| 7 | [`vera-niw-rfe-response`](vera-niw-rfe-response/) | Generates point-by-point RFE responses that quote each USCIS finding verbatim and rebut with evidence, updated metrics, and new exhibits | 541 |
| 8 | [`vera-niw-entrepreneur`](vera-niw-entrepreneur/) | Evaluates and guides entrepreneur/founder NIW petitions using the USCIS Policy Manual's entrepreneur-specific framework (Jan 2025 update) | 300 |

**Total: ~3,995 lines of encoded expert reasoning across 8 skills.**

> **Got a weak research profile?** If `vera-niw-evaluate` flags insufficient publications or citation impact, I can help with that too. Check out [**ai-research-pipeline**](https://github.com/VeraSuperHub/ai-research-pipeline) — my other skill suite that takes a research question and dataset to a publication-ready manuscript, end-to-end.

## Tools

In addition to skills, this suite includes standalone tools that feed data into the pipeline:

| Tool | What It Does | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| [`GoogleScholar`](GoogleScholar/) | Extracts citation metrics, publication lists, and h-index from Google Scholar (Python + Colab notebook) | `vera-niw-assemble` (Section 3: Academic Credentials) |

---

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- [Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise](https://claude.ai/upgrade) subscription
- Code execution enabled (Settings → Capabilities)

### Installation

**Step 1 — Download the skill**

Download the ZIP file for the skill you want from this repo. Each skill folder is a standalone package.

You can download individual skill folders, or clone the entire repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/niw-skill-suite.git
```

**Step 2 — Upload to Claude**

1. Go to [Settings → Capabilities](https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities)
2. Scroll to the **Skills** section
3. Click **"Upload skill"**
4. Upload the skill's ZIP file
5. Toggle the skill **on**

That's it. Claude will automatically invoke the skill when your request matches its description — no manual activation needed. You'll see the skill appear in Claude's chain of thought as it works.

**Install one skill at a time.** Each skill is a separate ZIP upload. For the full pipeline, install all 8.

### Google Scholar Tool Setup

The `GoogleScholar/` directory contains a Python scraper for extracting citation metrics. You can run it locally or via Google Colab:

```bash
cd GoogleScholar
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy
python -c "from scholar import get_profile; print(get_profile('YOUR_SCHOLAR_ID'))"
```

Or open `scholar_colab_demo.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for interactive use.

### Recommended Workflow

Start with **Evaluate** to get your go/no-go assessment. If the verdict is QUALIFIED or LIKELY_QUALIFIED, proceed through the pipeline in order:

```
Evaluate → Endeavor → Pillar (×3) → Recommendation (×N) → Assemble → PL Review
```

Each skill's output is designed as input for the next skill in the pipeline. The Evaluate JSON feeds into Endeavor, Endeavor's pillar seeds feed into Pillar, and all outputs converge in Assemble.

---

## Usage Examples

**Evaluate — Am I qualified?**
```
I'm a senior data scientist at a Fortune 500 company with 5 years of experience.
I have 3 publications (12 citations total), 2 patents pending, and my fraud
detection system processes 2M+ transactions daily. Evaluate my NIW case.
```

**Endeavor — Define the proposed endeavor:**
```
I just completed NIW_Evaluate and got LIKELY_QUALIFIED. Here's my JSON output:
[paste evaluate output]
Help me draft my proposed endeavor.
```

**Pillar — Write petition content:**
```
Here's my endeavor statement and three pillar definitions from NIW_Endeavor:
[paste endeavor output]
Write the petition content for Pillar 1.
```

**PL Review — Adversarial quality check:**
```
Review my completed petition letter as a USCIS officer. Find every weakness
that would trigger an RFE.
[paste petition letter]
```

**RFE Response — Fight back:**
```
I received this RFE on my NIW petition. Here's the RFE notice and my
original petition letter. Generate a point-by-point response.
[paste RFE notice]
[paste original petition]
```

## How It Works

Each skill encodes expert judgment as a structured decision process:

```
Expert Knowledge (5,000+ AAO decisions)
    ↓
Decompose into decision rules & rubrics
    ↓
Encode as structured AI instructions (SKILL.md)
    ↓
Add reference materials (rubrics, schemas, examples)
    ↓
Validate against test cases (evals/)
```

The key insight: an experienced NIW attorney doesn't use magic — they apply discoverable patterns built from hundreds of cases. Those patterns can be decomposed, encoded, validated, and improved by the community.

## FAQ

**Is this legal advice?**
No. See [DISCLAIMER.md](DISCLAIMER.md). These tools provide informational guidance only. Always consult a qualified immigration attorney for your specific case.

**Do I need to be technical?**
No. If you can use Claude, you can use these skills. Copy, paste, follow the prompts.

**Will this guarantee my NIW approval?**
No tool or attorney can guarantee approval. These skills help you identify weaknesses and build a stronger petition before filing.

**How is this different from ChatGPT prompts for NIW?**
Generic prompts produce generic output. Each skill here encodes hundreds of specific decision rules — failure pattern detection, field-specific framing, USCIS-language calibration — derived from systematic analysis of AAO decisions. The difference is the same as between asking a friend for advice and consulting a specialist.

**Can I use this with GPT-4 or other models?**
The skills are optimized for Claude but the instructions are model-agnostic text. They may work with other capable models, though output quality may vary. The `vera-niw-pl-review` folder includes a [standalone deployable prompt](vera-niw-pl-review/references/vera-niw-pl-review-deployable.md) that works with any LLM API.

**Can I contribute?**
Yes. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
